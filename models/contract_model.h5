I'm sorry for the confusion, but .h5 is a file format for storing the weights of a trained model, not a code file. It's generated by TensorFlow during the training process and doesn't contain human-readable code. Therefore, I can't provide the code for "AI_Lawyer/models/contract_model.h5". However, I can provide the code for training the model and saving it as a .h5 file if you'd like.
